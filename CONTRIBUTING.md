# Contributing guidelines
Thank you for your interest in supporting this project. I highly appreciate that you consider contributing to it.

## Pull requests
Unfortunately, I usually cannot find the time to review and merge Pull requests. For this reason, I have released these contributing guidelines, which basically state exactly this. I just want to be upfront about this, because I know that many contributors invest a lot of time into a pull request and that it can be frustrating, if it does not get merged. However, I will make sure to fix urgent issues and add new features that are wanted and needed every now and then. Feel free to fork this script and adjust it to your own needs ðŸ™‚

## Issues
If you notice an issue, want to give feedback, or want to request a new feature, make sure to open an Issue here. I will regularly look at them and fix urgent ones as soon as possible. Other users of the script might also be able to help you.
